How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

With uitilizing open source software that allows testing to be automated as well as 
static and unit testing, one can focus on the quality of the product being delivered. 


How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

A powerful and tangible way of evaluating how user needs are implemented and evluated are
creating a JUnit test for those functional requirements. As an example, on this project we were
tasked with a contact id that did not exceed 10 characters and that it was unique. 

How do I approach designing software?

Software design is complex and therefore requires that it be developed with the tests in mind. 
In other words, building a program around the tests that are developed based on the customer needs. 
Alongisde that regression testing once the system is scaled to include more functions.
